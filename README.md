# Two-Layer-Neural-Network
the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.


Overview
============

The network has the following architecture:
input - fully connected layer - RELU - fully connected layer - softmax
The outputs of the second fully-connected layer are the scores for each class.


Dependencies
============

* Numpy 
* matplotlib
* scipy 
### Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies


Usage
===========

To check the implementation of code, just open two_layer_net.ipynb and run the all the cells
